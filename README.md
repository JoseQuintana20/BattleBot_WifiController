# BattleBot_WifiController
This project showcases Karonte, a BattleBot controlled in real-time via a responsive web interface hosted on an ESP32. It uses an L298N H-bridge for motor control and activates a weapon through an active-low relay. The ESP32 acts as a WiFi access point, allowing control from any device with a web browser.
